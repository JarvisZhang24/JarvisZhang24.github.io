Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are transforming how AI systems understand multimodal data. Here's a quick intro to get started.

## What are VLMs?

VLMs process both images and text, enabling tasks like:
- Image captioning
- Visual question answering
- Multimodal search

## Popular Models

**CLIP** - Learns aligned vision-language representations  
**BLIP** - Strong at image-text understanding  
**LLaVA** - Visual instruction following

## Quick Start with Hugging Face

```python
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image

# Load model
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

# Generate caption
image = Image.open("image.jpg")
inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
caption = processor.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(caption)
```

VLMs are an exciting area with lots of potential for robotics and embodied AI!
