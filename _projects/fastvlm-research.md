Fine-tuning large vision-language models on H100 GPUs for enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities. This project focuses on improving the performance and efficiency of VLMs for real-world applications.

**Key Objectives:**
- Optimize training pipelines for multi-GPU H100 infrastructure
- Explore efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, QLoRA, etc.)
- Benchmark performance on vision-language understanding tasks
- Develop applications for robotics and embodied AI

**Impact:** Advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal AI systems that can understand and reason about both visual and linguistic information.
