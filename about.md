I'm **Yichen Zhang**, a Computer Engineering graduate student at **New York University**, passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge vision, language, and action. My research focuses on making AI systems more capable of understanding and interacting with the world through multimodal learning.

## 🔬 Research Interests

### Vision-Language Models (VLM/VLA)
Exploring multimodal understanding and how AI systems can reason about both visual and linguistic information. Currently working on fine-tuning large vision-language models for real-world applications.

### Reinforcement Learning
Developing efficient learning algorithms for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. Interested in sample-efficient methods and policy optimization.

### Robotics & Embodied AI
Building intelligent systems that can perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world through Vision-Language-Action frameworks.
