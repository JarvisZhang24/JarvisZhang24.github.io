<p class="bio-text">
I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <strong>New York University</strong>, where my research focuses on vision-language models, reinforcement learning, and embodied AI. I am broadly interested in building intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world.
