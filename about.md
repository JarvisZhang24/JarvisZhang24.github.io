## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at **New York University (NYU)**, driven by the vision of creating intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in complex environments.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **natural language processing**, and **robotics**. I'm particularly fascinated by:

- How machines can understand both visual and linguistic information
- How AI agents can learn from minimal supervision
- How we can build robots that safely interact with the real world
