# Hi, I'm Jarvis Zhang 👋

I'm an AI researcher passionate about building intelligent systems that understand and interact with the world. Currently pursuing **Computer Engineering at NYU**, I focus on the intersection of vision, language, and embodied intelligence.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- **Vision-Language Models (VLM)**: Multimodal understanding and reasoning
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Bridging perception and embodied control
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Sample-efficient learning and policy optimization
- **Robotics**: Intelligent manipulation and task planning

## 📫 Get in Touch
