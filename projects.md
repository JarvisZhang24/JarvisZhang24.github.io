### ðŸ¤– Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Manipulation

**Status**: In Progress  
**Tech Stack**: PyTorch, ROS, MuJoCo

Building an end-to-end VLA model that enables robots to follow natural language instructions for manipulation tasks. The model integrates vision encoders, language models, and policy networks to bridge high-level commands with low-level control.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-task instruction following
- Real-time visual feedback processing
- Sim-to-real transfer learning

### ðŸ§  Efficient Fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models

**Status**: Completed  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Hugging Face, PEFT, LoRA

Explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, Adapters) for large vision-language models. Achieved competitive performance with 10x fewer trainable parameters.

**Results**:
- 95% of full fine-tuning performance
- 90% reduction in memory usage
- Faster training convergence
